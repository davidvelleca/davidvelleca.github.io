            <p>It's no surprise that 2020 was a difficult year for all, but even through all of the trials, there were likely some bright spots for everyone. Looking forward to 2021 and the next challenges that lie ahead, I wanted to take the opportunity to look back on 10 impactful moments in 2020. I challenge you to do the same, tag 5 connections and let 2020 go out on a high(ish) note. After all, some of our best growth and learning comes from persevering in the face of adversity. <a href="/posts/archive/20201231 - 2020 Reflection">MORE</a></p>

        <p>When it comes to data visualization, we’ve seen several trends over the past year – first there were visual resumes, then bar chart races, but most recently visualizations have been dominated by COVID-19 data.  Some of these visualizations have been very good, while others have been a bit misleading.  The prevalence of COVID-19 visualizations means that individuals who do not necessarily interact with data or visualizations on a regular basis are being flooded with graphs and charts.  When the visualizations are clear and representative of the data, this is a good thing; when they fail to use best practices, they can be misleading or even fear or panic inducing...<a href="/posts/archive/2020406 - MO-COVID-19.html">MORE</a></p>

While all interconnected, I draw from different sources for the inspiration for these three pieces.

A friend and I were discussing the new Screen Time feature in iOS 12.0 that tracks and conveniently displays how much time the user has spent on his or her iPhone.  He mentioned that the results and insights were both shocking and slightly depressing at the same time.  Fortunately, he’d used that data to make some changes in his life, and was happy with the results to date.
